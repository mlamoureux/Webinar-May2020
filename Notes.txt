May 2020

Derived from the Callysto notebook.

Run in Anaconda on Mac, in order to use SlideShow.
- launch JupyterFull_P38 environment
- launch JupyterLab (2.0.1) as the notebook one doesn't wrk.
- switch to the "tree" version by changing the http address

Needed to install ffmpeg in the Anaconda environment called JupytreFull_P38 to get the animations to work.
